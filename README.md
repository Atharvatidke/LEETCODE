Problem Statement:

⚬ Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

⚬ Assume there is only one solution, and no more than one can be used for the same element.

⚬ You can return the answer in any order.
ㅤㅤ

Constraints:

⚬ `2 <= nums.length <= 10⁴`

⚬ `-10⁹ <= nums[i] <= 10⁹`

⚬ `-10⁹ <= target <= 10⁹`

⚬ Only one valid answer exists.
